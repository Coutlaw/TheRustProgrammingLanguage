# ðŸ¦€ The Rust Programming Language ðŸ¦€
These are some of the projects from [The Rust Book](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Steve-Klabnik/dp/1593278284) that I read trying to learn Rust for some personal projects.

This repo is divided up into chapters the way the book breaks them up. I am leaving this as a public repo for now, so feel free to browse around. 

Notes: Some directories have Markdown files explaining what the section was about and things I learned, others just have rust projects and code comments.
